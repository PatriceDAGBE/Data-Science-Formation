      "The Israeli military has killed at least 67 people waiting for UN aid lorries in northern Gaza, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry says. The UN World Food Programme said its 25-truck convoy \"encountered massive crowds of hungry civilians which came under gunfire\", soon after it crossed from Israel and cleared checkpoints. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that it had \"fired warning shots\" to remove \"an immediate threat\". It disputed the number of reported deaths. On Saturday it warned that extreme hunger was increasing in Gaza and growing numbers of people were arriving at its facilities \"in a state of extreme exhaustion and fatigue\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We warn that hundreds of people whose bodies have wasted away are at risk of imminent death due to hunger,\" it said. The UN has also said civilians in Gaza are starving and called for an urgent influx of essential goods. Six more people were killed waiting for aid elsewhere in Gaza and more than 150 people were injured, some seriously, the ministry said. In total, health authorities said 88 people had been killed by Israeli gunfire and air strikes so far on Sunday. Many of the casualties from northern Gaza were taken to Shifa hospital in Gaza City. The medical director there, Dr Hassan al-Shaer, told BBC Arabic on Sunday the facility had been \"overwhelmed\" and was directing the wounded to other field hospitals. Outside the hospital one woman told BBC Arabic that \"the whole population is dying\". \"Children are dying of hunger because they have nothing to eat. People are surviving on water and salt… just water and salt,\" she said. There have been almost daily reports of Palestinians being killed while seeking food since late May. On Saturday at least 32 people were killed by Israeli gunfire near two aid distribution points in southern Gaza, according to the ministry. Many of the incidents have taken place near sites run by the controversial US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which uses private security contractors to distribute aid from sites in Israeli military zones, but some have taken place near aid brought in by the UN.\n",

      "Watch: Environment secretary 'furious' over water bill hikes\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of times sewage is discharged by water companies will be halved by 2030, the environment secretary has pledged. Steve Reed told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that people were \"furious\" about the \"broken\" state of the water sector, and that they could judge him at the next election if he had not overseen an improvement. Serious pollution incidents by water companies in England rose by 60% in 2024 to the highest number on record, data published by the Environment Agency on Friday shows. It marks the first time the government has set a clear target on the number of pollution spills, following public outcry over the state of the UK's waterways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reed said he had spoken to people \"up and down the country\" who were \"furious about the state of our water\". He told Laura Kuenssberg that he would be held accountable if there had not been improvements in water quality by the next election. \"Politicians come and say we're going to do things. Of course our job should be on the line if we don't,\" he said. There has been widespread scrutiny of water companies over the increasing number of sewage discharges into UK waterways amid rising bills - all while the firms paid out millions to executives and shareholders. The Environment Agency said water companies recorded 2,801 pollution incidents in 2024, up from 2,174 in 2023. Of those, 75 were considered to pose \"serious or persistent\" harm to fisheries, drinking water and human health - up from 47 in the year previous. A landmark review of the industry by the Water Commission is due on Monday, which could include a recommendation to scrap the sector's regulator Ofwat. Reed said Ofwat was \"clearly failing\" and that \"regulation must change\" - but did not say whether it would be shuttered. The environment secretary added that he had been given the commission's report but had not yet had time to read it thoroughly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getty Images The Environment Agency said water companies recorded 2,801 pollution incidents in 2024\n",
      "\n",
      "While the number of discharges rose last year, water bosses in England were paid £7.6m in bonuses, according to the government. In June, it barred bonus payouts at six firms that had failed environmental and consumer standards. Reed said the extra £691,000 awarded to the boss of Southern Water, almost doubling his income, was \"outrageous\". He urged Southern's boss to \"think how this looks to their customers\" and turn down the pay rise. But Reed ruled out taking water companies back into public ownership, which he said would \"take years\" and be too expensive. \"Nationalisation would cost upwards of £100bn that we'd have to take away from the NHS and schools to give to the owners of the companies that are polluting.\" Victoria Atkins, Conservative MP and shadow secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, acknowledged that \"more should have been done when we were in government\". But she said Labour needed to be clearer about who was paying for the new investment the sector needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "James Wallace, chief executive of charity River Action UK, said the target seemed \"admirable\" but was ultimately a \"political pledge\" instead of something legally binding. Reed's vow forms part of wider government plans to improve the water sector, including a commitment to work with devolved governments across the UK to ban wet wipes containing plastic, among other measures. A record £104bn is due to be invested into the water sector over the next five years to improve its infrastructure. As a result, consumer bills are expected to rise on average by £123 annually - though for Southern Water customers this could be as much as £224. The Environment Agency has also received £189m to support hundreds of enforcement offices to inspect and prosecute water companies, with the fines retroactively paying for this.\n",
      "\n",
      "England has a combined sewage system, which means both rainfall and sewage are processed through the same system. Last year, rainfall levels were up, which may have overwhelmed some ageing water company infrastructure. But, despite variations in rainfall, discharges that result in serious pollution are a breach of companies' permits and legal obligations. Many incidents are reported to the Environment Agency by the companies themselves, but of 4,000 inspections carried out last year by the regulator, nearly a quarter of sites were in breach of their permits.\n",

Beneath the salt flats of the Atacama Desert lie the world's largest reserves of lithium, a soft, silvery-white metal that is an essential component of the batteries that power electric cars, laptops and solar energy storage. As the world transitions to more renewable energy sources, the demand for it has soared. In 2021, about 95,000 tonnes of lithium was consumed globally - by 2024 it had more than doubled to 205,000 tonnes, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). By 2040 it's predicted to rise to more than 900,000 tonnes. Most of the increase will be driven by demand for electric car batteries, the IEA says. Locals say environmental costs to them have risen too. So, this soaring demand has raised the question: is the world's race to decarbonise unintentionally stoking another environmental problem?\n",

Chile's government has framed the plans as part of the global fight against climate change and a source of state income. Mining companies predominantly extract lithium by pumping brine from beneath Chile's salt flats to evaporation pools on the surface.

She points to a spot where, for the first time in 14 years, flamingo chicks hatched this year. She attributes the \"small reproductive success\" to a slight reduction in water extraction in 2021, but says, \"It's small.\" \"Before there were many. Now, only a few.\" The underground water from the Andes, rich in minerals, is \"very old\" and replenishes slowly. \"If we are extracting a lot of water and little is entering, there is little to recharge the Salar de Atacama,\" she explains.\n",

On property in the salt flats, mined by the Chilean company SQM, almost one-third of the native \"algarrobo\" (or carob) trees had started dying as early as 2013 due to the impacts of mining, according to a report published in 2022 by the US-based National Resources Defense Council. But the issue extends beyond Chile too. In a report for the US-based National Resources Defense Council in 2022, James J. A. Blair, an assistant professor at California State Polytechnic University, wrote that lithium mining is \"contributing to conditions of ecological exhaustion\", and \"may decrease freshwater availability for flora and fauna as well as humans\". He did, however, say that it is difficult to find \"definitive\" evidence on this topic.\n",

The issue is that mining companies can take steps to mitigate that damage. \"What [mining companies] should have done from the very beginning was to involve these communities,\" she says. For example, before pumping lithium from underground, companies could carry out \"social impact assessments\" - reviews which take into account the broad impact their work will have on water, wildlife, and communities.\n",

      "For their part, mining companies now say they are listening. The Chilean firm SQM is one of the main players. At one of their plants in Antofagasta, Valentín Barrera, Deputy Manager of Sustainability at SQM Lithium, says the firm is working closely with communities to \"understand their concerns\" and carrying out environmental impact assessments. He feels strongly that in Chile and globally \"we need more lithium for the energy transition.\" He adds that the firm is piloting new technologies. If successful, the idea is to roll these out in their Salar de Atacama plants. These include both extracting lithium directly from brine, without evaporation pools, and technologies to capture evaporated water and re-inject it into the land. \"We are doing several pilots to understand which one works better in order to increase production but reduce at least 50% of the current brine extraction,\" he said.\n",

She says it's unknown how the salt flats could \"resist\" this new technology and the reinjection of water and fears they are being used as a \"natural laboratory.\" Sara Plaza, whose family also raised animals in the same community as Raquel, is anxious about the changes she has seen in her lifetime. She remembers water levels dropping from as early as 2005 but says \"the mining companies never stopped extracting.\"\n",

Without water, without agriculture. What are they going to live on?\" \"Maybe I won't see it because of my age, but our children, our grandchildren will.\" She believes mining companies have extracted too much water from an ecosystem already struggling from climate change. \"It's very painful,\" she adds. \"The companies give the community a little money, but I'd prefer no money. \"I'd prefer to live off nature and have water to live.\"\n",

He says Peine has been forced to change \"our entire drinking water system, electrical system, water treatment system\" because of water shortages. \"There is the issue of climate change, that it doesn't rain anymore, but the main impact has been caused by extractive mining,\" he says. He says since it started in the 1980s, companies have extracted millions of cubic metres of water and brine – hundreds of litres per second. \"Decisions are made in Santiago, in the capital, very far from here,\" he says.\n",

His community has secured some economic benefits and oversight with companies but is worried about plans to ramp up production. He says while seeking technologies to reduce the impact on water is welcome that \"can't be done sitting at a desk in Santiago, but rather here in the territory.\"\n",

It says increasing production capacity will be based on incorporating new technologies to minimise the environmental and social impact and that the high \"value\" of lithium due to its role in the global energy transition could provide \"opportunities\" for the country's economic development.

But one of the world's current solutions is – according to locals – exacerbating this. There is a common argument from people who support lithium mining: that even if it damages the environment, it brings huge benefits via jobs and cash. Daniel Jimenez, from lithium consultancy iLiMarkets, in Santiago, takes this argument a step further. He claims that environmental damage has been exaggerated by communities who want a pay-out.\n",

      "\"This is about money,\" he argues. \"Companies have poured a lot of money into improving roads, schools – but the claims of communities really go back to the fact they want money.\" But Prof Stegen is unconvinced. \"Mining companies always like to say, 'There are more jobs, you're going to get more money',\" she says. \"Well, that's not particularly what a lot of indigenous communities want. It actually can be disruptive if it changes the structure of their own traditional economy [and] it affects their housing costs. \"The jobs are not the be all and end all for what these communities want.\"\n",

Their main question is why they are paying the price. \"I think for the cities maybe lithium is good,\" Raquel says. \"But it also harms us. We don't live the life we used to live here.\" Faviola does not think electrifying alone is the solution to climate change. \"We all must reduce our emissions,\" she says. \"In developed countries like the US and Europe the energy expenditure of people is much greater than here in South America, among us indigenous people.\" \"Who are the electric cars going to be for? Europeans, Americans, not us. Our carbon footprint is much smaller.\" \"But it's our water that's being taken. Our sacred birds that are disappearing.\" Top image credit: Getty Images\n"

While the audience continues to applaud the performance, a man from the stage wings is seen attempting to wrestle the flag away from the cast member but they resist and hold on to it for the remainder of the curtain call. Two other performers, stood alongside the one launching the protest, can be seen lurching to their side as the tussle plays out.

      "Nigel Farage has accused some council officials of obstructing the work of Reform UK councillors, as he defended the way the party is running local authorities. Reform gained control of 10 councils in May's local elections in England. But the party's leader told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that in some areas Reform councillors were being \"hamstrung\" by existing bureaucracies. Reform has pledged to cut wasteful spending and improve the efficiency of the councils it runs but some of its spending decisions have faced criticism, while opponents say there has been little concrete action to reduce costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Warwickshire, opposition parties have criticised Reform UK for planning to hire political assistants at a cost of up to £190,000 a year, saying the money should be spent on front-line services instead. The council's interim leader, George Finch, said the move was necessary because council staff have been unable to come up with \"imaginative ideas\" to resolve key issues. The 19-year-old was put in charge of the council after Reform's previous council leader resigned, citing health reasons. Challenged over whether this was a good use of taxpayers' money, Farage told the BBC: \"At the moment, we're finding that we're very, very hamstrung. \"We're going into existing administrations, we're facing obstructionism in many places. \"And Warwickshire is a very, very good example.\" He added: \"It's better to have staff who support the will of the democratically elected councillors than it is to have public sector staff opposing them.\" Warwickshire County Council has been approached for comment. Farage said that in some areas Reform was \"working reasonably well with existing administrations\" but in others there was \"genuine, deliberate obstructionism\". He added that some officials \"don't want to show us the books\" and where money is being spent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reform UK's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - modelled on the cost-cutting initiative set up by US President Donald Trump and previously led by billionaire Elon Musk - was launched in June. The unit is made up of about 15 unelected volunteers and is run by Zia Yusuf, who quit as party chairman in June, before returning to Reform to head up Doge days later. Reform says Kent County Council will be the first to be audited but in other areas, such as Staffordshire, the council says it is still waiting for the unit to start work. Defending the pace of progress, Farage said: \"Bear in mind, we're not the Labour Party. We haven't got hundreds of staff. \"We're a party that's been really active for just over a year. We're growing in size. \"Yes, we have a Doge team who've not been everywhere yet. But you've seen already, us highlighting examples of extravagant expenditure.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Farage was also challenged over spending decisions in Scarborough, where the town council has approved a 600% increase in the Reform mayor's allowance, from £500 to £3,500 a year. The mayor has defended the move, saying the allowance helps to cover his expenses and allows him to carry out his duties efficiently. Farage said he had \"no idea\" about the situation in the Reform-run council, adding: \"Is he doing it or she doing it as a full-time job? I've no idea.\" \"What we could do is just get multi-millionaires to stand as candidates everywhere and indeed our Doge team are doing the work unpaid,\" he said. \"If people have got resources and they do it for free, that's great. I don't know the Scarborough Council situation.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "It's a hot and sticky Friday in the middle of the summer holidays and cars are flooding onto Edinburgh Airport's approach road. There are few places to stop, but in almost every lay-by a steady stream of drivers await friends and loved ones touching down from their holidays. They are all parked in a half-mile radius from the entrance to the terminal building in a bid to beat so-called \"kiss-and-fly\" charges in the official drop-off zone. Research by the RAC, released this week, found that more than half of the country's busiest airports have raised drop-off fees in the last 12 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Edinburgh, drivers face a £6 tariff for a 10-minute stay at a specific drop-off and pick-up zone metres from the main terminal building. Every minute beyond that allowance will cost them an extra £1. Meanwhile, Edinburgh Airport's short-stay terminal car park costs £7 for up to 15 minutes wait time and £14 for 30 minutes. Other short-stay car parks further from the terminal largely cost between £7 and £10, significantly increasing in cost beyond an hour, while some are free for a limited period.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lay-by near a roundabout at Edinburgh Airport was almost full\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, drivers here look to beat the system, waiting in nooks and crannies along Eastfield Road for a message that their passengers have arrived. They then drive a few hundred metres towards the Moxy or Hilton hotels and pick them up as they leave the airport complex, exiting hastily to avoid risking a fine for parking on double yellow lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Close to the Moxy, next to a farm gate by a grass verge, Caroline O'Brien, 52, is waiting in a lay-by for her husband and children after they returned from a holiday to Paris. She says she had previously been charged £24 for under 30 minutes in the drop-off zone and decided not to take any chances this time. \"You don't know if the plane is going to be early or late in and I don't want them to be standing around,\" she says. \"For pick-up and drop-off, I think a couple of pounds [would be fair]. You're only there a few minutes for them to get their cases and then right back in the car and away again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The pickup and drop-off zone at Edinburgh Airport does not inform drivers about fees on their approach\n",
      "\n",
      "Drivers approaching via Eastfield Road pass three roundabouts on the way into the main terminal, the closest of which leads them on to a one-way system which means they have to pass through the drop-off zone. There is no signage on the approach to inform them of the charges, however there is when they are already inside the drop-off zone. Drivers pay once they exit the drop-off area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edinburgh Airport is among those to have increased their prices in the last year\n",
      "\n",
      "London Gatwick, Bristol, Leeds Bradford, Southampton and Stansted charged the top rate of £7 in the RAC survey. Edinburgh is level with London Heathrow, Birmingham, Liverpool John Lennon and Glasgow in charging £6 for the initial drop off. By contrast, at nine of the 10 busiest airports in the European Union there are no drop-off fees. Rontom Tschopp, 32, from Switzerland, had just dropped a friend off at the terminal but was unaware there would be a charge for doing so.\n",

      "Rontom Tschopp said there were no drop-off charges at his local airport in Switzerland\n",
      "\n",
      "He says his local airport, in Basel, did not charge for the same service. He says: \"I was a bit flabbergasted to be honest, because we don't have that in Switzerland. \"I think it creates a form of aversion to do the little things like drop off your friends. If I had known about the fees, we probably wouldn't have had such a heartfelt goodbye, it would have been: 'No, go now, there's extra fees'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sheila McPheely said the free drop-off zone was useful for some, but not those with mobility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edinburgh Airport does have other road links with the city centre through bus services, while the tram network also stops just outside. It also has a free drop-off zone about half a mile (0.8km) from the main terminal building, across the tram line and near a car rental service. Drivers can park there for 30 minutes free of charge, but it costs £10 up to an hour after that and £18 for between one and three hours. Up another side street, near a vacant commercial business, Shiela McPheely is waiting to collect her sisters from their holiday in Albufeira in Portugal. She says the cost of the drop-off zone is \"appalling\" and is planning to pick her sisters up at the free drop-off point, despite both having mobility issues. \"It's just greedy. You pay enough for your flights and when you get in there, you get a tea or a coffee, so they are getting money from you that way,\" Sheila, 79, says. \"There is a bit you can park in that is free, but that is all very well if you are young and fit, but one of my sisters has a sore back, the other one is waiting for a hip operation, so it's difficult for them.\"\n",

      "Finn picks up a small, white, teabag-like pouch from a round, brightly coloured tin and places it between his upper lip and gum. He and his mates use nicotine pouches - or snus - until they vomit, he tells me. The strength of the nicotine - at 150mg a pouch - is enough, he says, to \"immobilise\" them, especially when they use two or three in one go. \"It's the burn at first,\" the 17-year-old explains. \"You feel this burning sensation against your gums, and then you get the hit.\" The hit, he says, is far stronger than any cigarette, and often he and his friends will lie down before they put the pouch in place, hidden under their lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finn tells me how easy they are to use; they are so inconspicuous he even uses them at school. \"I've sat in class before and had one in my mouth that was so strong I was all over the place,\" he says. \"I was sweating, salivating and struggling to concentrate.\" In the end, he says, his teacher noticed he looked \"bright green\" and he made his excuses and bolted out of his maths lesson. Finn, who only wants us to use his first name, is not boasting. In fact, he says, he regrets ever having started using pouches. He now sees himself as an addict and wants to warn others. \"I just got bored of vaping, and now I'm stuck on these.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "A growing number of young people are using nicotine pouches - some swapping from vaping or smoking, others trying nicotine for the first time. Figures seen by BBC News suggest there has been nearly a four-fold rise in use by 16 to 24-year-olds in the UK - from less than than 1% in 2022, to 3.6% in 2024. The pouches are widely sold online, in supermarkets and in corner shops. Priced at around £5 for a pack of 20, they come in exotic flavours with varying nicotine strengths - from 1.5mg to claims of 150mg for a more \"extreme\" experience. Anyone can buy them. There is no minimum age as with cigarettes, vapes and alcohol. Nor is there any restriction on the strength of the nicotine in the pouches. \"I've heard of children as young as 11 or 12 nipping to shops and buying them,\" warns Kate Pike, Trading Standards' lead officer for tobacco and vaping. She says her organisation is receiving an increasing number of reports from parents and teachers that nicotine pouches are being sold to children. \"It is incredibly frustrating that there is nothing we can currently do to prevent them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What are nicotine pouches?\n",
      "\n",
      "Also known as white snus, they contain nicotine extracted from tobacco leaves, sodium carbonate, flavourings, and sweeteners They often have a high pH value, an effect of the ingredient sodium carbonate, which allows the nicotine inside the pouch to penetrate the soft lining on the gum more quickly and enter the bloodstream, resulting in stronger nicotine kicks Source: Institute of Odontology, University of Gothenburg\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms Pike is urging the government to prioritise the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which, if passed, will make it illegal to sell these pouches to under 18s. \"We need to take action against those who either deliberately or uncaringly risk children getting hooked on a highly addictive product,\" she says. Despite containing large amounts of the drug, nicotine pouches do not need to display the warning, \"This product contains nicotine which is a highly addictive substance\" on their packaging.\n",

      "Kent Trading Standards Kent Trading Standards' ports team seized a vanload of 66,000 tubs of nicotine pouches destined for the UK in February 2025\n",
      "\n",
      "If the pouches have more than 16.7mg of nicotine, then under general product safety regulation, there should be a skull and cross bones symbol on the packaging and a list of the chemical components written in English. This regulation, Ms Pike says, is increasingly being flouted, with Trading Standards officers seizing thousands of illegal products across the UK. The pouches are significantly less harmful than cigarettes, and because chemicals do not enter the lungs, they may carry fewer risks than vapes. Harry Tattan-Birch, a senior researcher from University College London, says pouches are the \"least harmful way\" to ingest nicotine. \"If they were used to stop people smoking or vaping, they could have a positive public health effect - but it would only be positive if they were used by those wanting to quit, not those who are trying nicotine for the first time.\" While they may carry fewer health risks than cigarettes and vapes, there are cardiovascular risks for people using pouches with high quantities of nicotine - and there is growing concern over the damage nicotine pouches do to gums.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finn has been using pouches for more than a year and says he reached a point where his \"mouth was shredded to bits\" and, on one occasion, he \"peeled half [his] gum off\". Dr Patric Saraby, a Swedish dentist based in Bournemouth, has treated patients who are nicotine pouch users with gum lesions so deep it's possible to see the root of the tooth. \"The long-term damage of these products is extremely worrying,\" he says. One of his patients, a 23-year-old student, started to develop lesions in his gums while studying for his exams. He was using five pouches a day to help him quit vaping and, he says, to help him focus on his studies. \"It started as a recreational thing, but it quickly took hold,\" the student says. \"I became worried when a bit of my gum - where I had been placing the pouch - came off.\" He's now nicotine-free and his gums are starting to heal after quitting vaping and pouches eight months ago.\n",

      "Sintija Miļuna-Meldere White lesions caused by repeated nicotine pouches\n",

He is worried that the \"tidal wave of nicotine pouch use\" that has hit Sweden - the home of the original, tobacco-based snus - will soon hit the UK. There, 25% of 16 to 29-year-olds are users and dentists are seeing increasing numbers of patients with painful inflammation that is taking months, sometimes years, to heal. A five-year study has just started at the University of Gothenburg into why white snus is leaving such damage compared to the tobacco-based products. Dr Gita Gale, a specialist in oral medicine who is leading the study, says it's \"alarming\" how many people are using this product given how little is known about the long-term consequences of its use.\n"

      "Shorter school summer holidays may sound like a child's nightmare – but they could be a relief for parents who are trying to juggle childcare with their jobs. Some schools now have five-week breaks in the summer, but a two-week October half term. But is there an argument for shorter summers at all schools? Could a shorter break help with learning? Or do pupils - and teachers - need the time to recharge? Would spreading out school holidays across the year help reduce the cost of family holidays, or would smaller windows create a rush to book time off? Let's take a look at some of the issues.\n",

      "Six weeks is a long time away from learning, especially for children whose parents are working or who can't afford lots of costly day trips, activities or a long family holiday. So while all children may forget a little of what they have learnt, families with more money can enrich their understanding by giving them other experiences, and this widens the learning gap. For many families with children, food is one of the biggest bills. During term time, more than a quarter of children across England are eligible for free school meals, and in some schools, it is closer to half of all pupils. As food costs have risen, there has been growing awareness of what is called holiday hunger, with some families struggling to feed children without school support. There are other factors too. While summer allows for playing outside, footy kickarounds and being in the garden, extending winter holidays may mean families need to heat their homes more in the daytime. England, Wales and Scotland all have six-week summer breaks, though Scotland's tends to be earlier, finishing in mid-August. In Northern Ireland, schools are closed for all of July and August. Most of England's schools are now academies who can set their own holidays, and some have already opted for five weeks in summer and two weeks in October. In Surrey, the county council has decided to follow suit for all the schools it supports from autumn 2026.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Wales, that model was put out to consultation, attracting more than 16,000 responses from parents and teachers. It was divisive. Only a narrow majority were in favour and in June 2024, the plans were put on hold. Parentkind, the charity for parent-teacher organisations, has released polling suggesting 53% of parents would like a four-week summer holiday, rising to 60% in families with a child with special educational needs. The same polling also suggests a four-week break is much less popular with teachers, with only 24% in favour of the idea. This may ultimately be a stumbling block. It is hard to recruit teachers because for the rest of the year, they have little to no flexibility in their working patterns, unusual now for many graduate roles. Summer is when teachers recharge and also pack in their planning and lesson preparation ahead of September. However, earlier this year, the chief inspector of schools at Ofsted, Sir Martyn Oliver, said he thought shorter breaks could be beneficial. He said after the long summer holiday, some children returned \"dysregulated\" and struggling to adapt to routine.\n",

      "The price of going away during the six-week school holidays can be eye-watering. This is because the high demand from parents and those working in education for those dates means travel firms can hike prices up and still sell out. So spreading some of these weeks out across the year could provide more opportunities to go away and lessen demand at any one time, thus bringing down prices. However, if the summer holiday was only four weeks long, it could also have the opposite effect of squashing the demand into a smaller time frame and pushing up prices further. One way to mitigate this would be for different regions to stagger their school summer holidays, suggests Which? Travel editor, Rory Boland. Holiday prices would come down \"only if travel firms can restrain themselves from massively inflating prices\", he says. Any price drops could also come at the expense of those who currently avoid going away during the school summer holidays, as they might find there are fewer bargains to be had. There could also be an impact on traffic jams, airport queues and overcrowded trains if everyone isn't making a dash for it at the same time. If there was a shorter summer break, employers would have to navigate a higher number of holiday requests over a smaller period of time. For instance, three people wanting to take two weeks off each over summer could be staggered over six weeks, but over four weeks might prove more tricky. If leave isn't possible, bosses should \"carefully consider\" flexible working to help balance workload with childcare, says David D'Souza, director of profession at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD).\n",

      "Are hotter summers a factor?\n",
      "\n",
      "Different countries have different holiday setups and it often comes down to weather. Hot countries like India - which has around two months of summer holiday - tend to have longer breaks, while more temperate countries often go shorter. In South Korea, the winter break is longer than the summer one, though some parents have suggested this should be evened out. Germany has a rotation system between the 16 states, though the Guardian recently reported there was a dispute due to two southern regions historically claiming what are seen as the prime slots because of their traditional harvests. The Met Office said this week that extreme weather was the new normal for the UK and with changing weather, do we need to change how we think about the summer break? According to BBC Weather forecaster Darren Bett, climate change means we are already seeing warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers - a pattern that is expected to continue. Heatwaves are expected to occur more often (there have already been three this year during exam season), but the hottest weather usually comes between July and August when the air and land has had longer to heat up. Darren says hay fever could also be an issue for pupils, particularly those sitting exams. He says a study by the University of Worcester showed oak and grass pollen seasons are starting earlier and birch pollen is becoming more severe. His conclusion is that the summer holidays should be longer and exams taken in autumn, but we're not sure how that would work.\n",

But what are her chances of making the UK a nation of investors, rather than risk-averse savers? Experts say women are investing less than men, and have warned the chancellor that some of her ideas could backfire and put off potential new investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Pink websites won't work'\n",
      "\n",
      "Cash savings accounts are steady and safe. The amount of interest varies between account providers, but it is clear how much the returns will be. They are popular when putting money aside for emergencies, or for holidays, a wedding or a car. By contrast, the value of investments in stocks and shares can go up and down, but with risk can come reward. Long-term investments can be lucrative, not only for individuals, but for the economy as a whole. Laura Suter, director of personal finance at investment platform AJ Bell, says Reeves and the finance sector should start by making investing more attractive to women. Having written reports on the Isa gender gap, she argues that, for too long, advertising about investing has been designed by men. Lisa Caplan, director at investment company Charles Stanley, agrees. \"It's not about making your website pink. It's about using less jargon, competitive language, and masculine imagery,\" she says. \"When clients who are women feel seen and understood, they will be more willing to trust their money to an adviser or even an investment platform. I think this is beginning to change.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wendy Lanham, Laura Colucci and Jema Arnold (left to right) say investing should be more accessible\n",
      "\n",
      "Jema Arnold is an investor, and works for UK shareholders' association ShareSoc. She wants investing to be part of general, honest conversation among friends, not private and hidden. \"I go to a book club. I want investing to be like that,\" she says. She is joined in a London cafe by Laura Colucci, who is in her 40s, and Wendy Lanham, who is 71. All three are divorcees, who were forced to think about their relationships with money when their marriages ended. Mrs Arnold was with an investment banker for 17 years. \"In many ways I was a traditional housewife,\" she says. Her now ex-wife had managed that side of the finances. \"I'd switched off that part of my brain when raising a daughter. That was a mistake. I felt foolish. I had to switch it back on again fairly quickly.\" Mrs Colucci was the same. \"There were investments in my name,\" she says. \"It was a huge learning curve in one year, when I had to take control.\" Mrs Lanham put her money into savings accounts. Only later did she consider moving some into investments. But that was a path that all three initially found difficult to join. \"People froze up and looked awkward when I talked about investing,\" says Mrs Arnold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Male domination\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs Lanham says she joined a group which met to talk about investing. The membership was entirely male. \"I bought myself a book called Investing for Idiots, went to a conference, and treated it like adult education,\" she says. \"I did not know anything, but hung in there, and the organisation changed.\" Now, the trio are members of SIGnet – a network of investor groups that meet in different parts of the UK, or online. It is not-for-profit and covers different areas of interest. It has lots of female members. But they say the chancellor will have little hope of getting more people to invest without initially improving their understanding, especially if they are trying it for the first time. \"There's no point telling people to go and run a marathon when they've never run before,\" says Mrs Colucci.\n",
      "\n",
      "British Gas The \"Tell Sid\" campaign is used as an example of encouraging investing\n",
      "\n",
      "Reeves told financial services and business bosses in her Mansion House speech this week that the \"negative\" narrative around savers investing money in stocks and shares needed to change. \"For too long, we have presented investment in too negative a light, quick to warn people of the risks without giving proper weight to the benefits,\" she said. She announced new adverts, reminiscent of the \"Tell Sid\" campaign of the 1980s, which encouraged people to invest in the newly privatised British Gas. Targeted messages will also be sent by banks to people who have money in low-interest accounts. Mrs Suter, from AJ Bell, says this needs to go beyond a \"token effort\". \"If it can get widespread coverage and enthusiasm, then it could make a difference,\" she says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Isa debate\n",
      "\n",
      "Carol Knight, chief executive of the Investing and Saving Alliance, says Reeves' ambition will be judged a success if more women, more people from ethnic minorities, and more people outside of London become investors. But Anna Bowes, savings expert at the Private Office, says the chancellor risks her plan backfiring by encouraging people to invest now when markets are jittery due to global uncertainty. That could lead to short-term losses. \"This needs to be done very carefully or it could put off a generation of investors.\" And she stresses that forcing people to consider a stocks and shares Isa by reducing the amount that could be put tax-free into a cash Isa would be a huge mistake.\n"

      "Yunarmia branch of the Zaporizhzhya region Russia's youth military organisation Yunarmia now operates in occupied regions of Ukraine, including Zaporizhzhia, where these girls live\n",
      "\n",
      "Being taught to love Russia starts early for children in occupied areas of eastern Ukraine. At a nursery school in Luhansk, more than 70 youngsters line up holding a long black and orange Russian military banner in the shape of a letter Z, the symbol of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Across the city, seven little girls jump up and down and gesture in front of a Russian flag to the brash song \"I am Russian\" that blares out of loudspeakers. When the music stops they shout out together: \"I'm Russian.\" In an occupied town called Anthracite, nursery school children have made trench candles and blankets for Russian soldiers. It is all part of a campaign that seeks not only to erase Ukraine's national identity, but also turn young Ukrainians against their own country. To do that with children you need teachers, and as many Ukrainian teachers have fled, the government in Moscow has begun offering lump-sums of 2m roubles (£18,500) to Russian teaching staff willing to relocate to occupied parts of Ukraine. The biggest and most powerful Russian organisation involved with children is Yunarmia (Youth Army). Affiliated with the Russian defence ministry, it accepts members as young as eight. It operates across all of Russia, and now has branches in occupied areas of Ukraine. \"We're providing children with some basic skills which they'll find useful should they decide to join military service,\" says Fidail Bikbulatov, who runs Yunarmia's section in occupied areas of the Zaporizhzhia region in south-east Ukraine. Bikbulatov was deployed from Russia's Bashkortostan, where he headed the \"Youth Guard\" division of the ruling United Russia party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yunarmia branch of the Zaporizhzhya region Yunarmia has been sanctioned by both the UK and the EU for the \"brainwashing\" and \"militarisation\" of Ukrainian children\n",
      "\n",
      "The EU has sanctioned Yunarmia, and Bikbulatov personally, for \"the militarisation of Ukrainian children\". Yunarmia is also targeted by UK sanctions for being part of Russia's campaign of \"brainwashing\" Ukrainian children. Yunarmia is not alone. Other Russian state-sponsored organisations that have moved in include \"Movement of the First Ones\" and \"Warrior\", a network of centres for \"the military and athletic training, and patriotic education of young people\" set up on Russian President Vladimir Putin's orders. These groups organise competitions such as Zarnitsa games rooted in the Soviet era, where Ukrainian children are required to demonstrate \"general military literacy, knowledge of Russian statehood and military history, firearms firing skills\". As the children progress through the education system, they are taught in Russian, using the Russian curriculum and textbooks that justify Russia's war against Ukraine. One such book portrays Ukraine as little more than a Western invention created to spite Russia, and argues that human civilisation would have possibly ended had Russia not invaded Ukraine in 2022. Lisa, who attended a school in occupied Donetsk, says students there were forced to take part in events celebrating Russia and the USSR. \"When they were preparing a parade of some sort, I, the whole of my class and the whole of my year were forced to attend every weekend and train. We had to hold posters. I could not say no, it wasn't my choice. I was told I had to do it to graduate,\" Lisa says. \"Every time lessons started, our teacher made us stand up, put a hand on our hearts and listen to the Russian anthem, which she made us learn by heart, too.\" Lisa now lives in the US and has been posting about her experiences on TikTok.\n",

More than 230 Ukrainian drones were downed over Russia since Saturday morning - including 27 over the capital - according to the Russian defence ministry. According to Russia's aviation watchdog, the four major airports serving the capital were disrupted and more than 130 flights also had to be redirected. All have since resumed normal operations. Meanwhile, at least three people were killed during Russian air strikes on Ukraine overnight, according to regional officials.\n",

      "Russia's Association of Tour Operators (Ator) said on Sunday that Moscow airports were closed 10 times in 24 hours due to the strikes. The Kaluga region, southwest of Moscow, was also affected. Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted 45 drones since Saturday morning, resulting in Kaluga International Airport also being temporarily closed. Russia's defence ministry said drones were also shot down over regions near the Ukrainian border including Rostov and Bryansk, as well as over the Black Sea. No fatalities were reported. This is not the first time that Ukrainian drone attacks have caused travel disruption in Russia. In May, at least 60,000 passengers were stranded at airports across the country after Kyiv launched more than 500 drones in a 24-hour period, according to Russia's defence ministry.\n",

      "\n",
      "A Scottish ultra-runner finished so far ahead in a 100-mile race that she was already home by the time the rest of the field crossed the line. Anna Rutherford ran the inaugural Rat Race between Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland and Edinburgh Castle in 17 hours and 23 minutes – more than two hours ahead of the closest male competitor. The mother-of-three told how she sang Dolly Parton's 9 to 5 to keep herself going during the race and even diverted to check if a man flat on his back on a golf course was ok. However, the lawyer, 43, still managed to finish fast enough that she was driven back home to Peebles by her parents when the other 600 competitors arrived in the early hours of Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna, originally from Milngavie, near Glasgow, began the race in the grounds of Bamburgh Castle at about 07:00 on Saturday and crossed the finish line just after 00:30 on Sunday. The route followed the east coast through Berwickshire, the Borders and East Lothian before reaching the finish at the Ross Bandstand in Edinburgh's Princes Street Gardens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anna said she only overtook the man leading the race before her about half-way through, meaning she ran the final 50 miles by herself and finished two hours ahead of the fist male and five ahead of the first female. She said she took to singing Dolly Parton's country hit as she ran up the Royal Mile towards the finish, before heading home to sleep. \"I was singing 9 to 5 running up the Royal Mile and everyone was singing along with me,\" she told BBC Scotland News. \"Because the race finished in Princes Street Gardens, you couldn't make a lot of noise, so I collected my medal and my parents had waited at the finish line for me. \"It was beyond my wildest dreams to run 100 miles in that time. But I just went home and went straight to bed.\"\n",

Anna said she went through an intense training period leading up to the race, which led to a hospital visit after she began experiencing headaches and feeling faint. She said she was running about 120 miles (193km) a week at the height of her training schedule.\n",

Back then, she credited eating stock cubes provided by a support van with helping her to complete the cross-country route. This time, she said she mixed stock powder with pretzels and took on gels and hydration at 10-mile stopping points along the route. However, she managed to miss one feeding point, where she had stashed some hydration gels and a note of support from her son. She said she took inspiration from hero and Barkley Marathon finisher, Jasmine Paris, to overcome the mental blocks on the run. She said: \"It doesn't matter what the distance is, about 70 or 80% of the way through, it is going to feel really hard because you've done the hardest bit, you are getting tired, but there is still a long way to go. \"In a way, I just embraced it. There's a lot of really, really good ultra-runners out there, who talk about the psychology of getting into this pain cave and just knowing that and almost looking forward to it. \"Someone like Jasmine Paris, her saying 'just watch me' before she did the Barkley Marathons, I found that very humbling.\"\n",
